    uint256 supplyTotal = 0;


    function decimals() public view virtual override returns (uint8) {
        return 0;
    }

    constructor(uint _startingSupply) ERC20(tokenName, tokenSymbol) Ownable(msg.sender) {

        shopItemsManagement[2] = [100, 4];
        shopItemsManagement[3] = [200, 3];
    }

    function mintToken(address to, uint256 amount) public onlyOwner {
        _mint(to, amount);
        supplyTotal += amount;
    }

    function reward(address _player, uint _tokenAmount) public onlyOwner {
        _transfer(msg.sender, _player, _tokenAmount);
    }

    function AccountBalance(address _user) public view returns (uint) {
        return balanceOf(_user);
    }

    function BuyItem(uint8 _choice) public returns (bool) {
        if (shopItemsManagement[_choice][1] != 0) { 
            if (AccountBalance(msg.sender) >= shopItemsManagement[_choice][0]) {
                ownedItems[msg.sender].push(_choice);
                shopItemsManagement[_choice][1] -= 1;

                return true;

        }
        else {
            return false;
        }
    }

    function burnToken(uint256 amount) public {
        _burn(msg.sender, amount);
        supplyTotal -= amount;
    }

    function transferToken( address to, uint256 amount) public{
        _transfer(msg.sender, to, amount);
    }
}
```
To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.25" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile DegenGaming.sol" button.
